# Environment Variable Rename Summary

## Goal
Rename paywall fee environment variables to avoid confusion with launch fees.

## Changes Made

### 1. Environment Variables Renamed

#### Before (Paywall Fees)
```
FEE_AMOUNT_SOL=0.25          → PRO_FEE_SOL=0.25
FEE_AMOUNT_USDC=25           → PRO_FEE_USDC=25
NEXT_PUBLIC_FEE_AMOUNT_SOL=0.25 → NEXT_PUBLIC_PRO_FEE_SOL=0.25
NEXT_PUBLIC_FEE_AMOUNT_USDC=25  → NEXT_PUBLIC_PRO_FEE_USDC=25
```

#### After (Launch Fees - Unchanged)
```
LAUNCH_FLAT_FEE_SOL=0.02     ✅ (unchanged)
LAUNCH_SKIM_BP=200           ✅ (unchanged)
LAUNCH_FEE_WALLET=...        ✅ (unchanged)
```

### 2. Files Updated

#### `env.example`
- Updated all paywall fee variable names
- Added clear comments distinguishing Pro access vs Launch fees

#### `src/pages/api/paywall/notify.ts`
- Updated `FEE_AMOUNT_SOL` → `PRO_FEE_SOL`
- Updated `FEE_AMOUNT_USDC` → `PRO_FEE_USDC`

#### `src/components/UpgradePro.tsx`
- Updated `NEXT_PUBLIC_FEE_AMOUNT_SOL` → `NEXT_PUBLIC_PRO_FEE_SOL`
- Updated `NEXT_PUBLIC_FEE_AMOUNT_USDC` → `NEXT_PUBLIC_PRO_FEE_USDC`

### 3. Functionality Preserved

#### Pro Paywall (0.25 SOL / 25 USDC)
- ✅ Still verifies correct amounts
- ✅ Uses new `PRO_FEE_SOL` and `PRO_FEE_USDC` variables
- ✅ Frontend displays correct pricing

#### Launch Commit Flow (0.02 SOL + 2% skim)
- ✅ Still charges correct amounts
- ✅ Uses separate `LAUNCH_FLAT_FEE_SOL` and `LAUNCH_SKIM_BP` variables
- ✅ No interference with Pro paywall

### 4. Build Verification
- ✅ Application builds successfully
- ✅ No TypeScript errors
- ✅ All references updated consistently

## Benefits

1. **Clear Separation**: Pro fees vs Launch fees are now clearly distinguished
2. **No Confusion**: Developers can easily identify which fees apply to which feature
3. **Maintainability**: Easier to update Pro pricing without affecting launch fees
4. **Documentation**: Environment variables are self-documenting

## Migration Notes

### For Developers
- Update your `.env` file to use the new variable names
- Pro fees: `PRO_FEE_SOL` and `PRO_FEE_USDC`
- Launch fees: `LAUNCH_FLAT_FEE_SOL` and `LAUNCH_SKIM_BP`

### For Deployment
- Ensure new environment variables are set in production
- Old variables can be removed after migration is complete
- No code changes required beyond environment variable updates

## Testing Checklist
